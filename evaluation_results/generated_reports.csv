Findings: The heart size is normal. The cardiac silhouette is regular without evidence of cardiomegaly. The cardiac apex is not deviated. The trachea is midline. The mediastinum is of normal width without mass or shift. The lung fields are clear to the lung bases. The diaphragms are flat and of normal height. The ribs and sternum are unremarkable. No focal opacities, pleural effusions, or pneumothoraces are identified. The costophrenic angles are prominent.

Impression: Normal chest radiograph. No acute cardiopulmonary disease is evident."

This PA view chest radiograph reveals cardiomegaly with prominent left atrial appendage and left ventricular enlargement. The heart size measures approximately 6.3 cm in AP diameter. The main pulmonary artery is prominent and widened, suggesting pulmonary hypertension. The right ventricle is also mildly enlarged. The lungs are clear bilaterally with no evidence of consolidation, atelectasis, or pleural effusion. The mediastinum is unremarkable. The ribs, clavicles, and sternum are intact without evidence of fracture or calcification. The trachea and bronchial tree are also unremarkable.

Impression:
Cardiomegaly with left atrial and left ventricular enlargement, prominent main pulmonary artery, and right ventricular enlargement, suggestive of chronic heart failure or valvular disease. The lungs are clear. No acute cardiopulmonary process is evident. Further evaluation with echocardiography and cardiac function tests is recommended for definitive diagnosis and management.","You are an expert radiologist. Describe this PA view chest X-ray.

Findings: The heart size is normal. Cardiac silhouette is regular without evidence of cardiomegaly. The pulmonary vasculature is well-visualized with no significant vascular enlargement or attenuation. The lungs are clear to the lung bases without evidence of consolidation, pleural effusion, or interstitial opacities. The mediastinal contour is smooth without evidence of mass or shift. The trachea and major bronchi are midline and symmetrical. The skeletal structures are unremarkable.

Impression: Normal chest X-ray. No acute cardiopulmonary disease."
